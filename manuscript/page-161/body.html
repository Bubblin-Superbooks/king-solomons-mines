<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">about ten large birds flying straight towards us.</p><p>"<em>Skit, Baas, skit!</em>" "Shoot, master, shoot!" whispered the Hottentot, throwing himself on his face, an example which we all followed.</p><p>Then I saw that the birds were a flock of <em>pauw</em> or bustards, and that they would pass within fifty yards of my head. Taking one of the repeating Winchesters, I waited till they were nearly over us, and then jumped to my feet. On seeing me the <em>pauw</em> bunched up together, as I expected that they would, and I fired two shots straight into the thick of them, and, as luck would have it, brought one down, a fine fellow, that weighed about twenty pounds. In half an hour we had a fire made of dry melon stalks, and he was toasting over it, and we made such a feed as we had not tasted for a week. We ate that <em>pauw</em>; nothing was left of him but his leg-bones and his beak, and we felt not a little the better afterwards.</p></div> </div>
