Infadoos and Scragga walked with us, but their followers marched about one hundred paces ahead.</p><p>"Infadoos," I said at length, "who made this road?"</p><p>"It was made, my lord, of old time, none know how or when, not even the wise woman Gagool, who has lived for generations. We are not old enough to remember its making. None can fashion such roads now, but the king suffers no grass to grow upon it."</p></div> </div>
