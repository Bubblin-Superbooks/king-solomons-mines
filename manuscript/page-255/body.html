<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"Blood is good, the red blood is bright; there is no smell like the smell of new-shed blood. The lions shall lap it and roar, the vultures shall wash their wings in it and shriek with joy.</p><p>"I am old! I am old! I have seen much blood; <em>ha, ha!</em> but I shall see more ere I die, and be merry. How old am I, think ye? Your fathers knew me, and <em>their</em> fathers knew me, and <em>their</em> fathers' fathers' fathers. I have seen the white man and know his desires. I am old, but the mountains are older than I. Who made the great road, tell me? Who wrote the pictures on the rocks, tell me? Who reared up the three Silent Ones yonder, that gaze across the pit, tell me?" and she pointed towards the three precipitous mountains which we had noticed on the previous night.</p><p>"Ye know not, but I know. It was a white people who were before ye are, who shall be when ye are not, who shall eat you up and destroy you. <em>Yea! yea! yea!</em></p></div> </div>
