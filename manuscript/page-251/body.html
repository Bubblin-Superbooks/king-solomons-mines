<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Up went the rifle.</p><p>Bang! <em>thud</em>! and the ox was kicking on his back, shot in the ribs. The semi-hollow bullet had done its work well, and a sigh of astonishment went up from the assembled thousands.</p><p>I turned round coollyâ€”</p><p>"Have I lied, O king?"</p><p>"Nay, white man, it is the truth," was the somewhat awed answer.</p><p>"Listen, Twala," I went on. "Thou hast seen. Now know we come in peace, not in war. See," and I held up the Winchester repeater; "here is a hollow staff that shall enable thee to kill even as we kill, only I lay this charm upon it, thou shalt kill no man with it. If thou liftest it against a man, it shall kill thee. Stay, I will show thee. Bid a soldier step forty paces and place the shaft of a spear in the ground so that the flat blade looks towards us."</p></div> </div>
