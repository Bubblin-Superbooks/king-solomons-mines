Leaving Good to superintend the arrangement of our little camp, I took Sir Henry with me, and walking to the top of the slope opposite, we gazed across the desert. The air was very clear, and far, far away I could distinguish the faint blue outlines, here and there capped with white, of the Suliman Berg.</p><p>"There," I said, "there is the wall round Solomon's Mines, but God knows if we shall ever climb it."</p></div> </div>
