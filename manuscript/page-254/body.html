<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">speak in a thin and piercing voice—</p><p>"Listen, O king! Listen, O warriors! Listen, O mountains and plains and rivers, home of the Kukuana race! Listen, O skies and sun, O rain and storm and mist! Listen, O men and women, O youths and maidens, and O ye babes unborn! Listen, all things that live and must die! Listen, all dead things that shall live again—again to die! Listen, the spirit of life is in me and I prophesy. I prophesy! I prophesy!"</p><p>The words died away in a faint wail, and dread seemed to seize upon the hearts of all who heard them, including our own. This old woman was very terrible.</p><p>"<em>Blood! blood! blood!</em> rivers of blood; blood everywhere. I see it, I smell it, I taste it—it is salt! it runs red upon the ground, it rains down from the skies.</p><p>"<em>Footsteps! footsteps! footsteps!</em> the tread of the white man coming from afar. It shakes the earth; the earth trembles before her master.</p></div> </div>
