Come but one pace nearer, and we will put out the moon like a wind-blown lamp, as we who dwell in her House can do, and plunge the land in darkness. Dare to disobey, and ye shall taste of our magic."</p><p>My threat produced an effect; the men halted, and Scragga stood still before us, his spear lifted.</p><p>"Hear him! hear him!" piped Gagool; "hear the liar who says that he will put out the moon like a lamp.
